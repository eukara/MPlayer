MPlayer.app is a GNUstep port of MPlayerOSX.

![Overview](http://wiki.gnustep.org/images/2/20/Mplayer.app.png)

MPlayer.app is a front-end/controller for MPlayer, using its --slave API.
It is based off MPlayerOSX and contains changes towards building it on GNUstep.

It supports queuing of media-formats supported by MPlayer in a playlist.
The playback window it spawns is that of regular MPlayer.

I fixed it up, added some icons for the file-types it ought to support and
made the main app icon look like something you'd see on a GNUstep system.
